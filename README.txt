Golf Practice Tracker (Static HTML App)

How to run:
- Open index.html in a browser.
- Everything saves to your browser's localStorage on this device.

Files:
- index.html + log.js: logging page (date + drill + club + outcomes/contact)
- stats.html + stats.js: stats / filters + CSV export (raw shot logs)
- data.js: default drills + default clubs (edit here if you want)
- app.js: shared storage + aggregation helpers
- styles.css: styling

Tip (iPhone):
- If you want this to behave like an "app", add it to your Home Screen from Safari's share menu.

- Putting drills: contact section hidden automatically (Success/Miss still required)

Defaults updated: includes Driver + full drill list.

Backup:
- Use Export JSON to download a full backup (shots, clubs, drills, notes).
- Use Import JSON to restore on a new phone/browser.
